sorting algorithms

1. selection sort :

time : O(n*n) space O(1)
stable : not always but can be made via "stable selection sort"
inPlace : yes , as it requires no extra space

Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest)
element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.


2. bubble sort :

time : O(n*n) space : O(1)
stable : yes
inPlace : yes , as no extra space needed

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the
wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite
high.

* Repeatedly swap two adjacent elements if they are in wrong order
